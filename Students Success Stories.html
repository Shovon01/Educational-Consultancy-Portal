                <p class="coverageText">The task of finding a suitable school for a Master’s can be cumbersome, however, ApplyBoard is an orderly system that connects you with the school and makes the application process seamless and less stressful. ApplyBoard comes highly recommended by me – you can easily interact with each person in ApplyBoard and you don’t feel as though you are talking to a machine. Your challenges are a concern to them and their help is ever readily available every step of the way, including through your visa application process. It is hard to see an organization that is not necessarily out for their profit but your own. I am glad that I used ApplyBoard and that I have been admitted for my Master’s in Engineering Technology Management at Western Kentucky University through their help.
